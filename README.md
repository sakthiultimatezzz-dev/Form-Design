📋 MS Access Database Project: Data Entry &amp; Management.

Project Overview: Developed a custom relational database solution in MS Access to replace inefficient manual tracking processes for SBI Card. The primary objective was to standardize the intake of sensitive financial data, ensuring 100% data integrity and providing a structured foundation for downstream SQL reporting. By bridging the gap between raw data entry and high-level analytics, I created a "front-end to back-end" workflow that significantly improved operational accuracy.
