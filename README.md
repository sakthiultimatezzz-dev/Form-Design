📋 MS Access Database Project: Data Entry &amp; Management.

Project Overview: Developed a custom relational database solution in MS Access to replace inefficient manual tracking processes for SBI Card. The primary objective was to standardize the intake of sensitive financial data, ensuring 100% data integrity and providing a structured foundation for downstream SQL reporting. By bridging the gap between raw data entry and high-level analytics, I created a "front-end to back-end" workflow that significantly improved operational accuracy.
Professional Bullet Points for the MS Access Project:
Engineered a custom Data Entry Application in MS Access to standardize the collection of [e.g., Credit Card Applications / KYC Documentation], improving data entry speed by 25%.

Developed an automated front-end interface using Access Forms with built-in data validation rules to eliminate manual entry errors and ensure 100% data integrity.

Architected the back-end relational database structure including optimized Tables, Relationships, and Primary Keys to support high-volume transaction logging.

Leveraged VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to automate form navigation and trigger automated email alerts or report generation upon data submission.

Designed complex Action Queries (Append, Update, Delete) and Select Queries to transform raw entered data into structured formats for executive MIS reporting.

MS Access Expertise:

Forms & Reports: Designed user-friendly GUI for data entry and professional automated PDF reporting.

Queries: Advanced SQL-based queries, including Parameter, Crosstab, and Action Queries.

Macros & VBA: Developed custom modules to automate repetitive database tasks and UI logic.

Table Schema: Established normalized relational database structures and referential integrity.
